If you would’ve asked them about it after the 1960 Presidential debate, they would’ve said that he would never occupy the Oval Office, always destined to be in second place or as a lapdog to a much more popular politician. Yet, Nixon enters this election as the 35th and current President of the United States, enjoying popularity that rivals that of Dwight Eisenhower himself during his first term.</p><p> Domestically, Nixon has governed in a vein not entirely dissimilar to Eisenhower, with a strong focus on reforming programs such as welfare in order to reduce fiscal bloat while keeping the original intention of the program. Another area where Nixon has seen domestic success was that of Civil Rights, where his administration successfully lobbied Congress to pass the 24th Amendment, outlawing poll taxes in the South. In terms of foreign policy, his administration successfully orchestrated a coup in Cuba against Fidel Castro's Communist-aligned government, effectively making Cuba a United States puppet state. Another foreign policy challenge is the looming 'second Indochina War,' where staunch anti-Communists push for increased commitment, a stance met with some reluctance by the President.</p><p>With a robust economy, high approval rating, and the likelihood of an irrelevant opponent, it seems like it would take divine intervention to stop Nixon’s crusade.</p>","color_hex":"#b22b27","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/AAMeLB9.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":81,"fields":{"first_name":"Henry Cabot","last_name":"Lodge","election":9,"party":"Republican","state":"Massachussetts","priority":1,"description":"<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><p><i>’’It is never right to compromise with dishonesty.’’</i></p><p><p> In many ways, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., once a State House Rep, Senator, and Ambassador to the United Nations, could not be more different to Richard Nixon.

First is character. Second is ability, for without it, character may be misused. Third is diplomacy, without which character and ability might be wasted.’’</i></p><p>Governor Frank Goad Clement of Tennessee should not be here. </p><p> After running simply in an attempt to boost his national name recognition in anticipation for a planned run for the US Senate, Clement watched as the entire potential field either declined to run or dropped out due to scandal. Following Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson’s refusals to run, the nomination was left wide open, allowing for Clement to clinch the nomination on the 17th ballot, thanks to an uneasy alliance between Clement’s base, segregationists who initially supported Orval Faubus, and Westerners who previously backed Pat Brown, coming together to deny Hubert Humphrey the nomination.</p><p>Clement isn’t exactly an A-list candidate, but he isn’t a complete unknown, either; the governor is perhaps most renowned for his memorable keynote address at the 1956 Democratic Convention, delivered with a theatrical, almost Bryan-esque flair at the Chicago International Amphitheatre. Although his sermon-like speech served to strengthen his bond with the rural, religious, and working-class constituents in his home state and across the American heartland, it was panned by the media, Republican partisans, and even the establishment of his own party, leading to many predicting that his career in federal politics was dead. Perhaps they will be proven right after this election.</p><p>The governor finds himself in a challenging position currently, trailing President Nixon in every single poll. His campaign is not one that seeks to win, rather, it’s one that aims to keep the fragile Democratic coalition together for yet another cycle until the party once again tries to find an opening in the Republican machine in 1968. Still, that’s easier said than done; Clement must find a way to stop the bleeding of Black voters from the Democratic Party while ensuring that there is no Southern splinter candidacy, as well as attempting to hold previous Democrat margins in both the cities and the rurals. If Clement is able to pull this off, however, he may be able to give Tricky Dick an ever-so-slight scare.</p>","color_hex":"#1E48D7","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/S7dchN8.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":85,"fields":{"first_name":"Abraham","last_name":"Ribicoff","election":9,"party":"Democratic","state":"Connecticut","priority":1,"description":"<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><p><i>’’My greatest ambition is to leave the world a little better place than when I found it.’’</i></p><p><p>If you want to find a running mate that both fits your populist persona while mollifying the establishment, then Abraham Alexander Ribicoff is your man.
